# Dewey Decimal Training Game

This repository is my final POE submission for the module Programming 3B (PROG7312).

## About the application:

The goal of the application was to make a librarian training game that focused on Dewey Decimals, it was divided up into, part 1, part 2 and part 3.

Part 1 was to make a game that requires the user to organize books using their Dewey decimals numbers and arrange them from smallest to largest, based on numerical and then alphabetical order. 

Part 2 was to make a game that makes the user match the definitions in the right-hand column with the terms in the left column, or vice versa. Part two also required us to store the call numbers in a dictionary.

Part 3 was to make a game that makes the user correctly identify the call numbers for the description, making them go through each dewey level at a time. Part 3 also required us to use a tree data structure and read from an external file.

The assignment required that the game implement gamification features, the ones I included were sound effects, animations, difficulties & timers, and awards.

## Application Framework:

This application is a Windows Forms App (.NET Framework 4.8) developed using Visual Studio 2022.
